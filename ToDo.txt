To Do Next:
	Finish making glass box around spawn block
	Add sound effect to capture of objective
	Restrict commands via permissions
	Auto-Team balancing if attackers fail to capture objective after t minutes.  Move lowest kd defender to attackers (on death?)
		No removing last defender
	


Testing:
	Conquest:
		Connect deaths to ticket loss
		Connect tickets to victory checking
		Test victory conditions (1 team captures all points, or all other teams below 0 tickets).  Make sure correct messages are shown
		Test if removing team's tickets counter is a good idea after defeat
	Rush:
		Sound effect on capture
	Other:
		Change chat color bk to white on event end.
	
	
	
Long term Next:
	Game Mode: Push Map, basically Rush but both teams can capture
